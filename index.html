                    <h2> 1) Balance Sheet</h2>
                    <p>The balance sheet documents a company’s financial health at specific points in time, usually at the end of the quarter or fiscal year. The balance sheet includes assets, liabilities, and equity and follows the accounting equation:
                    </p>
                    <b>Assets = liabilities + equity.</b>   
                    <p>
                        The left side leaves you with what you own, whereas the right side shows what you owe. Your asset values should equal those of your liabilities and equity. </p>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 2) Assets</h2>
                    <p>Assets are resources that businesses control, in which the owner expects assets to generate future cash flow. Examples include inventory, equipment, and land. </p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 3) Liabilities</h2>
                    <p>Liabilities are debts, usually sums of money, that a business owes to another entity. Examples include expenses payable to suppliers, accounts payable, and business loans. </p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 4) Equity</h2>
                    <p>Shareholders’ equity (SE) tells you a company’s net value if liquidating assets paying off debts. To calculate shareholders’ equity, subtract total liabilities from assets:</p>
                    <b>Shareholders’ equity = total assets−total liabilities</b>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 5) Income Statement</h2>
                    <p>The income statement shows the business’s performance during a period, such as throughout the quarter or year. Focusing on revenue and expenses, the income statement depicts a company’s profit or loss. </p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 6) Revenue</h2>
                    <p>Revenue refers to the income generated from a business’s operations and activities. One way to calculate revenue is by multiplying the price of an item by the quantity sold.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 7) Expense</h2>
                    <p>Expense refers to money spent on utilities, salaries, and raw materials, and other items that a company incurs operating the business.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 8) Profit</h2>
                    <p>Also known as “net income” or the “bottom line”, your profit shows the difference between what a business earns and spends. Calculate profit earned by subtracting total expenses from total revenue. </p>
                    <b>Profit = total revenue - total expenses</b>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 9) Net Loss</h2>
                    <p>Using the profit equation, you can calculate a business’s net loss, or when total expenses exceed total revenue and the difference is negative.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 10) Cash Flow Statement</h2>
                    <p>A cash flow statement measures the cash generated (inflow) or used (outflow) by a company in a given period. Classify cash flow under operating, investing, or financing activities.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 11) Profit Margin</h2>
                    <p>Three types of profit margins are gross profit, net profit, and operating profit margin. Calculate your profit margins by dividing profit by revenue. Profit margins show a company’s growth potential and answer how much of each dollar of sale generates into profit. </p>
                    <b>Profit margin = (profit/revenue) x 100% </b>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">

                    <b>Profit margin = (profit/revenue) x 100% </b>
                    <p><b>Note:-</b> more revenue does not always translate to higher margins and more profit kept from sales. </p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 12) Return On Investment (ROI)</h2>
                    <p>Return on Investment (ROI) is a ratio measuring performance efficiency relative to how much a company spent on investments. Calculate ROI by dividing net profit from the investment cost. </p>
                    <b>ROI = (net profit / investment cost) x 100%</b>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 13) Variable Cost</h2>
                    <p>Variable costs change proportionally to production. For example, the cost of raw materials increases with the number of units purchased.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 14) FIXED COST </h2>
                    <p>Unlike variable costs, fixed costs stay the same regardless of changes in production. For example, a company pays the same amount in monthly rent. </p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 15) Cash Flow</h2>
                    <p>Cash flow is a measure of the amount of cash generated (or lost) through a businesses's operations. It's different than net profit, as net profit includes non-cash expenses (such as depreciation), and excludes some uses of cash (such as capital expenditures for new equipment, or repayment of outstanding debt). </p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 16) Business to Business (B2B)</h2>
                    <p>B2B transactions take place when a company sells goods or services to another company. </p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 17) BUSINESS TO CONSUMER (B2C) </h2>
                    <p>B2C transactions occur when a company sells goods or services to end-users.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 18) Best Practice </h2>
                    <p>Best practices are accepted as standard methods for executing a task for how they most effectively produce results. </p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 19) Deck</h2>
                    <p>This term is commonly used to describe a PowerPoint presentation. You could think of it as a “deck” of PowerPoint slides.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="defination">
                    <h2> 20) DELIVERABLE </h2>
